how to format a save:

ae : attribute end, represented by a "/"

attributes are expressed as numbers

[char id]ae[equipment][coins]ae

where:
[char id] : an int that represents which character was selected

[equipment] : ([item]ae) times 3, in the order: sword, shield, armor

[coins] : the number of coins, each didgit is seperated by ae

where:
[item] : [rarity]ae[index]

where:
[rarity] : the int that represents the items rarity

[index] : the item's index in the list returned by loot_dict[{rarity conversion from int to string}[rarity]]

this format will be used to carry character data between chapters

example save:

"0/0/0/0/2/0/3/5/0"

this represents:
character : Raisin
sword : rusted sword
shield : traveler's shield
armor : traveler's garb
coins : 50
